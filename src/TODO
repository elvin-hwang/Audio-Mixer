1. A React component to display added sounds in SoundManager, updates after a command has been submitted.
    - Implement the math and logic to render the sound as lines

Optional UI TASKS :
    - Make DSL a pop-up or smth, switching between pages causes error in soundbuttons - easy?
    - Hard code the location of the sound button - easy?
    - A pause/resume functionality - medium
    - A vertical red line that moves across the table when play is clicked, stops when pause is clicked, so we can see the current position.
        - This should also reset back to 0 when a user inputs a command, or when it hits 60
        - hard
