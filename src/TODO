* = Preferred
Optional TASKS :
    * - Add sample commands to DSL page
    * - Make DSL a pop-up or smth, switching between pages causes error in soundbuttons - easy?
    - Hard code the location of the sound button - easy?
    - A pause/resume functionality - medium
    - Catagorize by different sounds - easy
    * - A vertical red line that moves across the table when play is clicked, stops when pause is clicked, so we can see the current position.
        - This should also reset back to 0 when a user inputs a command, or when it hits 60
        - hard
